<h4 align="center">A Data Analysis course in Python by Ange Daumal</h4>

This course is taught as part of the ESILV master's degree.

Please follow the installation instructions in `get_started.md` to install
required softwares. The course will be taught in **Python**, the main language 
for data manipulation alongside R and MATLAB.

Each chapter is supposed to be done in ~3 hours.

## Chapter 1
* Set up & usage of **`jupyter notebook`**.
* Lesson 1: 
    - Introduction to **`numpy`**, a scientific computing package
* Lesson 2: 
    - Introduction to **`matplotlib`**, a 2d plotting library  
    - Introduction to **`pandas`**, a package providing data structures and
    analysis tools. 

## Chapter 2
* Lesson 1: 
    - Introduction to **`geopandas`**, a `pandas` extension to work with geospatial
    data 
    using `shapely` and `matplotlib`.
    - Usage of **`shapely`**, a package providing geometric objects and operations.
* Lesson 2:
    - Advanced usage of `pandas.DataFrame` methods.
    - Advanced usage of `matplotlib` methods.

## Chapter 3
* Lesson 1:
    - Implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using `numpy`.
    - Usage of `matplotlib` to visualize data in 3D
    - Usage of **`sklearn`**
* Lesson 2:
    - Usage of **`seaborn`**, a package based on `matplotlib` for high-level
    visualization
    - Implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) using `numpy`

## Chapter 4
* Lesson 1:
    - Introduction to Machine Learning algorithms
    - Usage and visualization of a Decision Tree
    - Learn how to validate and improve a model using `sklearn` methods
* Lesson 2:
    - Learn about ensemble methods (bagging, boosting)
    - Introduction to different machine learning models.

## Chapter 5
* Lesson 1:
    - Introduction to NoSQL databases, Hadoop and ElasticSearch
    - Use of **`sql-connector-python`** or **`py2neo`**
* Lesson 2:
    - Query an API with `requests`
